<p>Plants are really important for the planet and for all living things.
Plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen from their leaves, which humans and other animals need to breathe. 
Living things need plants to live - they eat them and live in them. Plants help to clean water too.
Plants bring natural beauty to our living spaces. ... They've been proven to reduce stress so well that one glance at a plant lowers your heart rate. 
They also help clean the air we breathe by absorbing toxins and acting as little oxygen factories. Plants simply make us feel better.<p>
